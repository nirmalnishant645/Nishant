        <h4>Green Economy</h4>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          Global warming is a serious threat to people as well as entire ecosystems, and there is a strong need for dramatically reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, to reduce that risk. Civil aviation accounts for 2% of global Carbon Dioxide(CO2) emissions and when its non-CO2 impacts are factored in, it contributes 4.9% of the Earth’s warming effect. Dramatic growth is forecasted in the demand for air travel over the next couple of decades in all geographic regions, with annual growth rates in Revenue Passenger Kilometres between 2010 and 2030 ranging from 3 to 6.2 percent. Even allowing for new technology, fuel projections out to 2050 show a 270 percent increase against 2006 levels, this is approximately 11 per cent of global CO2 emissions on a less than 2˚ C degree trajectory. It's vital to shift this sector as much as possible to the renewable sources of energy. Think of how the latest technologies assist in developing potential options for curbing emissions in this sector. Also how technologies like blockchain, AI while considering the environmental, economic and political consequences of potential markets can offer an overall assessment of climate policy in this sector.

        <h4>Physics Plasma: Pandemics + Technology</h4>
        <p style = "text-align: justify;">
          All objects have resonant frequencies at which they naturally oscillate. Pluck a guitar string and it will vibrate at a resonant frequency. But resonating can get out of control. A famous example is the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, which warped and finally collapsed in 1940 due to a wind that rocked the bridge back and forth at one of its resonant frequencies. Similarly, Viruses are susceptible to the same kind of mechanical excitation. An experimental group led by Prof. K. T. Tsen from Arizona State University have recently shown that pulses of laser light can induce destructive vibrations in virus shells. "The idea is that the time that the pulse is on is about a quarter of a period of a vibration," Sankey said. "Like pushing a child on a swing from rest, one impulsive push gets the virus shaking." If the shell of any virus can be compromised [by mechanical vibrations], then it can be inactivated. With this concept the team worked on to find out the resonating frequency of UV based on the formulae mentioned in research papers of plasma physics for calculating the resonating frequency of UV radiation on single stranded viruses.  According to that one needs 339-423 microwatt per second per square cm2 of ultraviolet light with a wavelength of 254 nm to get 90% air disinfection by measurements. The power of light decreases inversely with distance, so all viruses will die in 1 second inside a sphere with a radius of 1.4 meters at UV lamp power of 100 Watts. Based on the literature data in my previous letter, it is necessary to have a value A = 400 micro Watts per 1 cm2 = 4 W\m2 for 1 second. If you take a lamp with a power of 200 Watts, then all viruses inside a sphere with a radius of 2 meters will die in 1 second.
          <br>
          These simple techniques as of now are used in mercury lamps. The radiation ensures all disinfection of clothing, hair and skin of people- the treatment is useful and does not cause harm for man (only the eyes should be protected under glasses or closed for a few minutes).

        <h4>Cognition: Dolphin Intelligence</h4>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          A researcher based in Miami, decided to use CymaScope, a device that makes sound visible, for just this purpose. He recorded the sounds produced by a dolphin when “seeing” objects, then turned them into images and showed them to the same dolphin again, this time without sound accompaniment. The results showed that the dolphin managed to recognize the objects that corresponded to the images with an 86 % accuracy. Moreover, when the researcher showed the same pictures to another dolphin, it recognized the objects with the same accuracy! This suggests that cetaceans use sounds to communicate with each other in a similar way that we use words. Research has shown that Dolphins can imitate human actions and even how they solve problems. When a dolphin has one of its senses blocked, it can use other senses to mimic a human's movements. Dolphins may use complex nonlinear mathematics to assist their echolocation hunting and navigation.  Using echolocation, dolphins might be able to detect a pregnant woman's developing fetus, some experts say. They emit sounds in their environment and listen to the echoes that return — a process that helps them to identify the shapes and locations of objects. Researchers are experimenting on using the power of cognition of the dolphin mind and solve the complex human problems.
